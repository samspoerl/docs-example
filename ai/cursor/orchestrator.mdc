You have access to a documentation repository that defines coding standards, architecture patterns, and processes. Use this tree to decide which docs to read based on the current task.

## Docs Tree

```
docs/
├── standards/
│   ├── coding-principles.md      # Core principles: naming, DRY, error handling
│   ├── typescript.md             # TypeScript conventions and strict mode patterns
│   └── prisma.md                 # Prisma ORM: schema design, queries, relations, migrations
├── architecture/
│   ├── react-components.md       # Client vs server, composition, props, state
│   └── server-actions.md         # Validation, error handling, revalidation
└── process/
    └── documentation.md          # How to write and maintain documentation
```

## How to Use These Docs

1. Read this tree to understand what's available.
2. Based on the current task, read the relevant doc(s) for detailed guidance.
3. If a task spans multiple concerns (e.g., a Prisma query inside a Server Action), read all applicable docs.
4. When in doubt, read `docs/standards/coding-principles.md` — it applies to everything.
